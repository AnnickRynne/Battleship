# INTRODUCTION
Battleship is game written purely in Python and designed to run on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

# EXPERIENCE (UX)
The target audience: Playing on a Python terminal will attract an audience who is nostalgic of the first games that they used to play with in the seventies. But it's likely that a younger generation of 'gamers' will find the it interesting too. Terminal based games seem to be becoming popular again.

## User Stories
1. First Time Visitor Goals
   - I want the rules to be easy to grasp
   - I want to know my score against the computer

2. Returning Visitor Goals
   - I want to play again to improve my score
    
3. Frequent User Goals
   - I want to see if there is any added features

# CREDITS
## Code:
I followed some free tutorials found online to help me build the game with Python. I used some code from the Code Institute runnable exercices and challenges. I also found some useful code on GitHub:
